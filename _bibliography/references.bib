  abstract = {During the 1960s, small quantities of radioactive materials were co-disposed with chemical waste at the Little Forest Legacy Site (Sydney, Australia) in three metre deep, unlined trenches. Chemical and microbial analyses, including functional and taxonomic information derived from shotgun metagenomics, were collected across a six-week period immediately after a prolonged rainfall event to assess how changing water levels impact upon the microbial ecology and contaminant mobility. Collectively, results demonstrated that oxygen-laden rainwater rapidly altered the redox balance in the trench water, strongly impacting microbial functioning as well as the radiochemistry. Two contaminants of concern, plutonium and americium, were shown to transition from solid-iron-associated species immediately after the initial rainwater pulse, to progressively more soluble moieties as reducing conditions were enhanced. Functional metagenomics revealed the potentially important role that the taxonomically-diverse microbial community played in this transition. In particular, aerobes dominated in the first day followed by an increase of facultative anaerobes/denitrifiers at day four. Towards the mid-end of the sampling period, the functional and taxonomic profiles depicted an anaerobic community distinguished by a higher representation of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and methanogenesis pathways. Our results have important implications to similar near-surface environmental systems in which redox cycling occurs.},

  abstract = {The uptake and binding of uranium [as (UO2)2+] by a moderately acidophilic fungus, Coniochaeta fodinicola, recently isolated from a uranium mine site, is examined in this work in order to better understand the potential impact of organisms such as this on uranium sequestration in hydrometallurgical systems. Our results show that the viability of the fungal biomass is critical to their capacity to remove uranium from solution. Indeed, live biomass (viable cells based on vital staining) were capable of removing \textasciitilde{}16 mg U/g dry weight in contrast with dead biomass (autoclaved) which removed \textasciitilde{}45 mg U/g dry weight after 2 h. Furthermore, the uranium binds with different strength, with a fraction ranging from \textasciitilde{}20\textendash{}50\% being easily leachable from the exposed biomass by a 10 min acid washing. Results from X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the strength of uranium binding is strongly influenced by cell viability, with live cells showing a more well-ordered uranium bonding environment, while the distance to carbon or phosphorus second neighbours is similar in all samples. When coupled with time resolved laser fluorescence and Fourier transformed infrared measurements, the importance of organic acids and phosphates, and polysaccharides, likely released with fungal cell death, appear to be the primary determinants of uranium binding in this system. These results provide an important progression to our understanding with regard to uranium sequestration in hydrometallurgical applications with implications to the unwanted retention of uranium in biofilms and/or its mobility in a remediation context.},

After isolating, two fungal strains were selected as the best degrading microorganisms. Genetic identification by sequencing was carried out and they were identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Byssochlamys spectabilis . Their degradation ability was determined in liquid cultures with 100 $\mu$M of benzo[a]anthracene. T. longibrachiatum cultures showed highest degradation values (around 97\%) after 9 days, furthermore in a second batch the time was reduced to 6 days. To analyse the viability of industrial application, a continuous treatment in an expanded-bed bioreactor was developed operating at different residence times with T. longibrachiatum immobilised on cubes of nylon sponge. It is noticeable that the bioreactor working in continuous mode was able to operate without operational problems and attaining high degradation levels depending on the residence time.},

  abstract = {Although the presence of fungi in acidic mining systems has been widely established and attention paid to the problems created by their growth, limited consideration has been given to their role in community functioning. Seven acidophilic/acid-tolerant fungal strains were characterised from the process waters at one of Australia's largest uranium mines, the Ranger Mine in the Northern Territory. Process waters (raffinate) were typically very acidic (pH 1.7-1.8) and contained high concentrations of total dissolved/colloidal salts (\textasciitilde{}80-100 g/L). Fungal cultures were grown in raffinate and Mackintosh medium followed by enrichment in Mackintosh medium with glucose and yeast extract additions. Strains were isolated in potato dextrose agar at pH 3.0 and their characteristics examined in a synthetic medium similar in composition to their source environment. Isolates were identified by ribosomal ITS sequencing. This work provides important new insights into the occurrence of fungi in highly acidic environments, their dependence on other organisms and their potential role in the hydrometallurgical extraction of uranium.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are everywhere. Anthropogenic industrial environments are no exception, even when operating under extreme conditions. The mining of uranium by acid-leaching creates a suitable habitat for those organisms unconstrained by such conditions. This thesis approaches relevant aspects of the microbiology thriving in such systems and the potential impact upon industrial operations.
Analysis of samples from Ranger Uranium Mine (NT, Australia) showed a previously unobserved fungal community. A total of seven isolates composed of three different species, two of them new, were obtained. A combination of classical mycology techniques and modern phylogenetics enabled their classification and description as Fodinomyces uranophilus and Coniochaeta fodinicola.
Using the newly isolated species, C. fodinicola, as a model, the binding of uranium to fungal biomass was studied. Results showed that the sorption of uranium was a passive phenomenon strongly dependent on cell integrity, with the quantity of sorbed uranium substantially higher on dead cells. Uranium was bound via U\textendash{}O\textendash{}C and U\textendash{}O\textendash{}P linkages to polysaccharides and organic phosphates, with no indication of specific/individual ligand binding.
A bench-scale column reactor, used to assess biogeochemical process, showed the uranium was leached from the weathered ore in the first days of operation, when the most marked chemical changes occurred. The microbial community which developed in the columns was clearly defined by its habitat, with the ore dominated by Alicyclobacillus and Sulfobacillus, and the leachate by undetermined Caulobacteraceae. The eukaryotic community was exclusively present in the column surface and no archaea were present.
Sequencing the F. uranophilus and C. fodinicola genomes provided important insights into why these fungi thrive in such environments. Their adaption appears to relate to a range of expanded cellular tools involving proteins involved in cation exchange, ATPases, compatible osmolytes generation, DNA repair and proteins involved in the resistance to heavy metals/metalloids. Additionally, the whole genome duplication of F. uranophilus indicates resistance to hostile environments through regulatory divergence.
Overall, this thesis provides important novel findings in regards to the microbiology of the Ranger Uranium Mine, their interactions with uranium and clues about mechanisms that the endemic fungi use to survive under such extreme conditions.},

Oat stem rust [Puccinia graminis f. sp. avenae (Pga)] reduces the yield and quality of oat grain and forage significantly and is a major constraint to sustainable oat production. Stem rust is currently the most important disease of oats in southeastern Australia. Studies of pathogen genomics and genetic variability are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms that generate its variability, host-pathogen coevolution, and in the management of disease resistance. In this study, we used Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technology to sequence the Pga genome. A draft genome assembly containing 157 contigs with N50 over 2 Mbp and a total length of 87 Mbp was obtained using Falcon assembler. The genome contains 44\% repetitive sequences and has a GC content of 42\%. The PacBio assembly was further improved by Pilon using Illumina short-reads for error correction. The corrected assembly showed 9\% improvement compared to uncorrected one with  BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) assessment. 17,473 genes were predicted in Pilon-corrected assembly using Funannotate program with NCBI BRAKER1 pipeline. Full analysis with Interproscan, secretome prediction and comparative study are currently underway.},

This revealed a broad abundance of candidate and potentially undescribed taxa. Thus, we explored the same dataset trough genomic reconstruction and phylogenomics focusing specifically in Archaea. MegaHIT was used as assembler and CONCOCT as binning tool within Anvi'o, resulting in 318 refined bins with $\geq$50\% completeness and $\leq$10\% redundancy, (37 Archaea). A concatenated protein tree was constructed using 15 highly conserved ribosomal proteins. Protein sequences were mined with Phylosift, aligned with MAFFT L-INS-I, poorly aligned regions removed with BMGE prior concatenation. Optimal ML tree search was performed with IQ-TREE with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates and SH-aLRT. Phylogenomic analysis revealed archaeal bins corresponded to 10 different phyla, including 4 newly proposed divisions within the DPANN supergroup. In addition, we report an unprecedent number of bins (six total, five $\geq$50\% complete) from the anaerobic methane oxidising group ANME-2d. Annotation of the genomic bins and comparative analyses are currently being performed to establish the ecological function of these newly defined phyla.},

  abstract = {The biogeochemistry of the acid leaching of a non-sulfidic, weathered uranium ore from Ranger Mine (Australia) in relation to varied iron concentrations and Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratios was examined in this work. Controlled column studies which simulate a heap-leaching process, showed rapid uranium leaching during the initial stages of operation. This was thought to be a product of both the enhanced mobility of U(VI) in the stockpiled ore, possible aided by enhanced ion exchange with Fe(III) under higher Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratios. Indeed, it was observed that any elevated Fe(II) which was originally present in the leaching solution irreversibly hampered maximal uranium recovery when compared to Fe(III)-rich leaching counterparts (\textasciitilde{} 10\% in U recovery). Importantly though, the mine-derived native microbial community, once established, was able to oxidise the continuous supply of Fe(II). In doing so, the microbial consortium was able to restore chemical conditions amenable to enhanced uranium recovery. The Fe-oxidising bacteria (FeOB) did not correspond to mesophilic bacteria typically found in sulfidic ores. Furthermore, the planktic and benthic communities were vastly different from each other. Collectively, this research provides key insights into the biogeochemical processes that are important to maximising uranium resource recovery from heap leaching activities.},

  abstract = {The functional metagenomic potential of Shark Bay microbial mats was examined for the first time at a millimeter scale, employing shotgun sequencing of communities via the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform in conjunction with defined chemical analyses. A detailed functional metagenomic profile has elucidated key pathways and facilitated inference of critical microbial interactions. In addition, 87 medium-to-high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) were assembled, including potentially novel bins under the deep-branching archaeal Asgard group (Thorarchaetoa and Lokiarchaeota). A range of pathways involved in carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles were identified in mat metagenomes, with the Wood\textendash{}Ljungdahl pathway over-represented and inferred as a major carbon fixation mode. The top five sets of genes were affiliated to sulfate assimilation (cysNC cysNCD, sat), methanogenesis (hdrABC), Wood\textendash{}Ljungdahl pathways (cooS, coxSML), phosphate transport (pstB), and copper efflux (copA). Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase genes were over-represented at the surface, with PHA serving as a potential storage of fixed carbon. Sulfur metabolism genes were highly represented, in particular complete sets of genes responsible for both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Pathways of environmental adaptation (UV, hypersalinity, oxidative stress, and heavy metal resistance) were also delineated, as well as putative viral defensive mechanisms (core genes of the CRISPR, BREX, and DISARM systems). This study provides new metagenome-based models of how biogeochemical cycles and adaptive responses may be partitioned in the microbial mats of Shark Bay.},

  abstract = {While 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is not considered a state-of-the-art technique any more, it is now considered a well-matured technique for the routine screening of samples of microbiological interest. The maturity of the technique with the lower costs, have provided an increased demand even in areas foreign to typical research.
  
  OTUreporter was developed aiming to bridge the gap between a sequencing service provider without dedicated bioinformatics personnel, and a non-expert customer. OTUreporter was also designed keeping in mind customers with limited computing resources for the initial stages of the amplicon data analysis.
  
  Unlike many automated 16S rRNA gene amplicon tools such those made available by sequencing companies (e.g. Illumina's "16S Metagenomics" tool), OTUreporter is not a "black box" and uses software that it is actually used in research context for this matters.
  
  OTUreporter accesses BaseSpace directly to gather amplicon data and sequencing run details, avoiding any need for the manual download. The main program used in the background is mothur. OTUreporter uses a slightly modified version of the MiSeqSOP protocol for processing the amplicon data.
  
  The final output of OTUreporter is a report. The report summarises the details, not only of the analysis, but also of the sequencing jobs themselves. The report, based on a RMarkdown template, creates two different outputs of the same report: a slimmer printer-friendly pdf document, and an extended html output with interactive content.
  
  OTUreporter is currently in beta testing at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics.},

This revealed a broad abundance of candidate and potentially undescribed taxa in this iron-rich, radionuclide-contaminated environment. Thus, we explored the same dataset through genomic reconstruction and phylogenomics but focusing specifically in Archaea.
In total, we recovered 318 refined bins with $\geq$ 50\% completeness and $\leq$ 10\% redundancy, 37 of which belonged to Archaea. A concatenated protein tree was constructed using 44 highly conserved universal or Archaea-specific ribosomal proteins extracted from the archaeal MAGs plus $>$200 genomes from public databases. Phylogenomic analysis revealed archaeal bins corresponded to 10 different phyla, including 4 newly proposed divisions within the DPANN supergroup. While most of the new DPANN lineages show similarly reduced genomes, some contain highly connected amino acid and/or nucleotide biosynthesis pathways that can be tracked all the way to carbon source assimilation.
We report an unprecedent number of Methanoperedenaceae (ANME-2d) bins (six total, four $\geq$90\% complete). All Methanoperedenaceae bins are co-generic based on AAI/ANI values. Multihaem cytochromes with $>$10 binding sites are abundant in all bins, as well as PhaC/PhaE polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthetic systems. This suggests that metal respiration and PHA biosynthesis could be either widespread or at least ancestral to the lineage (in case the pathways were found to be interrupted).
Future research will try to discover the possible symbionts of the diverse DPANN organisms present in the site.},

  abstract = {Extreme environments have long served as microcosms to explore the boundaries of life and to model our understanding of early planetary conditions as the setting for abiogenesis. Recently, Archean terrestrial hot springs have emerged as leading candidate sites for the origin of life \textendash{} where the combination of a diverse range of chemistry and physical processes observed in modern and ancient systems address essential criteria for the evolution of cellular machinery. Within this scope, the Puga Valley geothermal springs in India present as compelling systems for examination due to enrichment in boron, a pivotal element in prebiotic chemistry and metabolism across the tree of life. Our group seeks to inform on the biology of these systems and illuminate their potential as analogues for ancient Earth and Mars hot springs. We are using the latest in gene sequencing technology to capture bacterial and archaeal dynamics along a geochemical transect to reveal how modern communities are shaped by extreme geothermal conditions. We are currently generating the microbial profiling data and will present on the diversity and community structure to reveal which groups are dominant and link possible metabolic processes with the geochemistry present. We expect to detect a range of extremophiles, including cyanobacteria which are common architects and primary producers of hot spring microbial mats. Our findings will contribute to developing an astrobiological model of the Puga hot springs and provide direction for further studies to unveil the alliance between life and terrestrial hot springs.},
