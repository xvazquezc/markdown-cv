  abstract = {Although the presence of fungi in acidic mining systems has been widely established and attention paid to the problems created by their growth, limited consideration has been given to their role in community functioning. Seven acidophilic/acid-tolerant fungal strains were characterised from the process waters at one of Australia's largest uranium mines, the Ranger Mine in the Northern Territory. Process waters (raffinate) were typically very acidic (pH 1.7-1.8) and contained high concentrations of total dissolved/colloidal salts (\textasciitilde{}80-100 g/L). Fungal cultures were grown in raffinate and Mackintosh medium followed by enrichment in Mackintosh medium with glucose and yeast extract additions. Strains were isolated in potato dextrose agar at pH 3.0 and their characteristics examined in a synthetic medium similar in composition to their source environment. Isolates were identified by ribosomal ITS sequencing. This work provides important new insights into the occurrence of fungi in highly acidic environments, their dependence on other organisms and their potential role in the hydrometallurgical extraction of uranium.},

  abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the nuclear industry after World War II resulted in the generation of substantial volumes of radioactive waste. This material was often buried in shallow trenches, a standard practice at the time, of which the Little Forest Legacy Site near Sydney (Australia) is an example. It has been reported that during heavy rain, the trenches exhibit an overflowing effect, analogous to a bathtub. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that intense rainfall events, are likely to introduce oxygen, and will therefore have an effect on the biology and chemistry inside the trenches during a fill-drain cycle.
Shotgun metagenomics was performed on water samples collected from a sample trench in triplicate across four time points during a 47-day period after a heavy rainfall event. Chemical parameters were monitored as well.
Functional analysis of the metagenome shows clear differences between the initial sampling points characterised by higher gene frequencies related to aerobic heterotrophic metabolism such higher cytochrome-c oxidase and several sugar transporters. The maximum for these indicators is reached at day 4, matching a surge in the proportion of Proteobacteria (63.6\% total prokaryotes). Conversely, anaerobic metabolism genes such those specific of methanogenesis or dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anaerobic taxa such class Methanomicrobia, show a progressive increase over time with a maximum at the final sampling day. These changes coincided with an increased proportion in soluble Fe, Am, and Pu, supporting our hypothesis that rainfall events can induces transient aerobic conditions potentially altering radiochemical mobility.},
