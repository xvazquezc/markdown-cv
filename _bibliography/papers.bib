  abstract = {The uptake and binding of uranium [as (UO2)2+] by a moderately acidophilic fungus, Coniochaeta fodinicola, recently isolated from a uranium mine site, is examined in this work in order to better understand the potential impact of organisms such as this on uranium sequestration in hydrometallurgical systems. Our results show that the viability of the fungal biomass is critical to their capacity to remove uranium from solution. Indeed, live biomass (viable cells based on vital staining) were capable of removing \textasciitilde{}16 mg U/g dry weight in contrast with dead biomass (autoclaved) which removed \textasciitilde{}45 mg U/g dry weight after 2 h. Furthermore, the uranium binds with different strength, with a fraction ranging from \textasciitilde{}20\textendash{}50\% being easily leachable from the exposed biomass by a 10 min acid washing. Results from X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the strength of uranium binding is strongly influenced by cell viability, with live cells showing a more well-ordered uranium bonding environment, while the distance to carbon or phosphorus second neighbours is similar in all samples. When coupled with time resolved laser fluorescence and Fourier transformed infrared measurements, the importance of organic acids and phosphates, and polysaccharides, likely released with fungal cell death, appear to be the primary determinants of uranium binding in this system. These results provide an important progression to our understanding with regard to uranium sequestration in hydrometallurgical applications with implications to the unwanted retention of uranium in biofilms and/or its mobility in a remediation context.},

  abstract = {In the present work, several samples from lab waste containers polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals were investigated as potential sources of PAH-degrading microorganisms. After isolating, two fungal strains were selected as the best degrading microorganisms. Genetic identification by sequencing was carried out and they were identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Byssochlamys spectabilis . Their degradation ability was determined in liquid cultures with 100 $\mu$M of benzo[a]anthracene. T. longibrachiatum cultures showed highest degradation values (around 97\%) after 9 days, furthermore in a second batch the time was reduced to 6 days. To analyse the viability of industrial application, a continuous treatment in an expanded-bed bioreactor was developed operating at different residence times with T. longibrachiatum immobilised on cubes of nylon sponge. It is noticeable that the bioreactor working in continuous mode was able to operate without operational problems and attaining high degradation levels depending on the residence time.},

  abstract = {Seven acidophilic/acidotolerant fungal strains were characterized from samples of process waters (raffinate) at one of Australia's largest uranium mines, the Ranger Mine in Northern Territory. They were isolated from raffinate, which typically were very acidic (pH 1.7\textendash{}1.8) and contained high concentrations of total dissolved/colloidal salts ($>$ 100 g/L). Five of the isolates correspond to two new acidotolerant Ascomycota fungi. The first is a member of a new genus, here described as Fodinomyces (Teratosphaeriaceae, Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes) and does not show clear close affiliation with any other described fungus in the scientific literature. The second belongs to the genus Coniochaeta (Coniochaetaceae, Coniochaetales, Sordariomycetes) and is closely related to Coniochaeta hansenii.},

  abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the nuclear industry after World War II resulted in the generation of substantial volumes of radioactive waste. This material was often buried in shallow trenches, a standard practice at the time, of which the Little Forest Legacy Site near Sydney (Australia) is an example. It has been reported that during heavy rain, the trenches exhibit an overflowing effect, analogous to a bathtub. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that intense rainfall events, are likely to introduce oxygen, and will therefore have an effect on the biology and chemistry inside the trenches during a fill-drain cycle.
Shotgun metagenomics was performed on water samples collected from a sample trench in triplicate across four time points during a 47-day period after a heavy rainfall event. Chemical parameters were monitored as well.
Functional analysis of the metagenome shows clear differences between the initial sampling points characterised by higher gene frequencies related to aerobic heterotrophic metabolism such higher cytochrome-c oxidase and several sugar transporters. The maximum for these indicators is reached at day 4, matching a surge in the proportion of Proteobacteria (63.6\% total prokaryotes). Conversely, anaerobic metabolism genes such those specific of methanogenesis or dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anaerobic taxa such class Methanomicrobia, show a progressive increase over time with a maximum at the final sampling day. These changes coincided with an increased proportion in soluble Fe, Am, and Pu, supporting our hypothesis that rainfall events can induces transient aerobic conditions potentially altering radiochemical mobility.},

  abstract = {The biogeochemistry of the acid leaching of a non-sulfidic, weathered uranium ore from Ranger Mine (Australia) in relation to varied iron concentrations and Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratios was examined in this work. Controlled column studies which simulate a heap-leaching process, showed rapid uranium leaching during the initial stages of operation. This was thought to be a product of both the enhanced mobility of U(VI) in the stockpiled ore, possible aided by enhanced ion exchange with Fe(III) under higher Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratios. Indeed, it was observed that any elevated Fe(II) which was originally present in the leaching solution irreversibly hampered maximal uranium recovery when compared to Fe(III)-rich leaching counterparts (\textasciitilde{} 10\% in U recovery). Importantly though, the mine-derived native microbial community, once established, was able to oxidise the continuous supply of Fe(II). In doing so, the microbial consortium was able to restore chemical conditions amenable to enhanced uranium recovery. The Fe-oxidising bacteria (FeOB) did not correspond to mesophilic bacteria typically found in sulfidic ores. Furthermore, the planktic and benthic communities were vastly different from each other. Collectively, this research provides key insights into the biogeochemical processes that are important to maximising uranium resource recovery from heap leaching activities.},

  abstract = {The functional metagenomic potential of Shark Bay microbial mats was examined for the first time at a millimeter scale, employing shotgun sequencing of communities via the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform in conjunction with defined chemical analyses. A detailed functional metagenomic profile has elucidated key pathways and facilitated inference of critical microbial interactions. In addition, 87 medium-to-high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) were assembled, including potentially novel bins under the deep-branching archaeal Asgard group (Thorarchaetoa and Lokiarchaeota). A range of pathways involved in carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles were identified in mat metagenomes, with the Wood\textendash{}Ljungdahl pathway over-represented and inferred as a major carbon fixation mode. The top five sets of genes were affiliated to sulfate assimilation (cysNC cysNCD, sat), methanogenesis (hdrABC), Wood\textendash{}Ljungdahl pathways (cooS, coxSML), phosphate transport (pstB), and copper efflux (copA). Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase genes were over-represented at the surface, with PHA serving as a potential storage of fixed carbon. Sulfur metabolism genes were highly represented, in particular complete sets of genes responsible for both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Pathways of environmental adaptation (UV, hypersalinity, oxidative stress, and heavy metal resistance) were also delineated, as well as putative viral defensive mechanisms (core genes of the CRISPR, BREX, and DISARM systems). This study provides new metagenome-based models of how biogeochemical cycles and adaptive responses may be partitioned in the microbial mats of Shark Bay.},
