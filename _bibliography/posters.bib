  abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the nuclear industry after World War II resulted in the generation of substantial volumes of radioactive waste. This material was often buried in shallow trenches, a standard practice at the time, of which the Little Forest Legacy Site near Sydney (Australia) is an example. It has been reported that during heavy rain, the trenches exhibit an overflowing effect, analogous to a bathtub. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that intense rainfall events, are likely to introduce oxygen, and will therefore have an effect on the biology and chemistry inside the trenches during a fill-drain cycle.
Shotgun metagenomics was performed on water samples collected from a sample trench in triplicate across four time points during a 47-day period after a heavy rainfall event. Chemical parameters were monitored as well.
Functional analysis of the metagenome shows clear differences between the initial sampling points characterised by higher gene frequencies related to aerobic heterotrophic metabolism such higher cytochrome-c oxidase and several sugar transporters. The maximum for these indicators is reached at day 4, matching a surge in the proportion of Proteobacteria (63.6\% total prokaryotes). Conversely, anaerobic metabolism genes such those specific of methanogenesis or dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anaerobic taxa such class Methanomicrobia, show a progressive increase over time with a maximum at the final sampling day. These changes coincided with an increased proportion in soluble Fe, Am, and Pu, supporting our hypothesis that rainfall events can induces transient aerobic conditions potentially altering radiochemical mobility.},

  abstract = {During the 1960s, small quantities of radioactive materials were co-disposed with chemical waste at the Little Forest Legacy Site (Sydney, Australia) in three-metre-deep, unlined trenches. Prior research aimed to investigate functional and population dynamics during a rainfall event using shotgun metagenomics. This revealed a broad abundance of candidate and potentially undescribed taxa. Thus, we explored the same dataset trough genomic reconstruction and phylogenomics focusing specifically in Archaea. MegaHIT was used as assembler and CONCOCT as binning tool within Anvi'o, resulting in 318 refined bins with $\geq$50\% completeness and $\leq$10\% redundancy, (37 Archaea). A concatenated protein tree was constructed using 15 highly conserved ribosomal proteins. Protein sequences were mined with Phylosift, aligned with MAFFT L-INS-I, poorly aligned regions removed with BMGE prior concatenation. Optimal ML tree search was performed with IQ-TREE with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates and SH-aLRT. Phylogenomic analysis revealed archaeal bins corresponded to 10 different phyla, including 4 newly proposed divisions within the DPANN supergroup. In addition, we report an unprecedent number of bins (six total, five $\geq$50\% complete) from the anaerobic methane oxidising group ANME-2d. Annotation of the genomic bins and comparative analyses are currently being performed to establish the ecological function of these newly defined phyla.},

  abstract = {While 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is not considered a state-of-the-art technique any more, it is now considered a well-matured technique for the routine screening of samples of microbiological interest. The maturity of the technique with the lower costs, have provided an increased demand even in areas foreign to typical research.
  
  OTUreporter was developed aiming to bridge the gap between a sequencing service provider without dedicated bioinformatics personnel, and a non-expert customer. OTUreporter was also designed keeping in mind customers with limited computing resources for the initial stages of the amplicon data analysis.
  
  Unlike many automated 16S rRNA gene amplicon tools such those made available by sequencing companies (e.g. Illumina's "16S Metagenomics" tool), OTUreporter is not a "black box" and uses software that it is actually used in research context for this matters.
  
  OTUreporter accesses BaseSpace directly to gather amplicon data and sequencing run details, avoiding any need for the manual download. The main program used in the background is mothur. OTUreporter uses a slightly modified version of the MiSeqSOP protocol for processing the amplicon data.
  
  The final output of OTUreporter is a report. The report summarises the details, not only of the analysis, but also of the sequencing jobs themselves. The report, based on a RMarkdown template, creates two different outputs of the same report: a slimmer printer-friendly pdf document, and an extended html output with interactive content.
  
  OTUreporter is currently in beta testing at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics.},

  abstract = {During the 1960s, small quantities of radioactive materials were co-disposed with chemical waste at the Little Forest Legacy Site (Sydney, Australia) in three-metre-deep, unlined trenches. Prior research has investigated functional and population dynamics during a rainfall event using shotgun metagenomics. This revealed a broad abundance of candidate and potentially undescribed taxa in this iron-rich, radionuclide-contaminated environment. Thus, we explored the same dataset through genomic reconstruction and phylogenomics but focusing specifically in Archaea.
In total, we recovered 318 refined bins with $\geq$ 50\% completeness and $\leq$ 10\% redundancy, 37 of which belonged to Archaea. A concatenated protein tree was constructed using 44 highly conserved universal or Archaea-specific ribosomal proteins extracted from the archaeal MAGs plus $>$200 genomes from public databases. Phylogenomic analysis revealed archaeal bins corresponded to 10 different phyla, including 4 newly proposed divisions within the DPANN supergroup. While most of the new DPANN lineages show similarly reduced genomes, some contain highly connected amino acid and/or nucleotide biosynthesis pathways that can be tracked all the way to carbon source assimilation.
We report an unprecedent number of Methanoperedenaceae (ANME-2d) bins (six total, four $\geq$90\% complete). All Methanoperedenaceae bins are co-generic based on AAI/ANI values. Multihaem cytochromes with $>$10 binding sites are abundant in all bins, as well as PhaC/PhaE polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthetic systems. This suggests that metal respiration and PHA biosynthesis could be either widespread or at least ancestral to the lineage (in case the pathways were found to be interrupted).
Future research will try to discover the possible symbionts of the diverse DPANN organisms present in the site.},
